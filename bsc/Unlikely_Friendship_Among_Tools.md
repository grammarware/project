# Unlikely Friendship Among Tools

**[ProVerB](http://slebok.github.io/proverb/)**, or **Program Verification Book**, is a project collecting information about software tools for program verification of all kinds, starting from simple libraries for manipulating some specific kind of automata, to elaborate platforms for building complicated tools. Each entry contains data and metadata, describing what the tool does, what are its inputs and outputs, how formal are certain kinds of artefacts that it requires, when was it published, is the source code available, etc.

This BSc final project involves using the dataset behind ProVerB to find matches among the tools that are not currently explicitly expressed. For example, two completely unrelated tools may be using the same format for some information: if one of them uses it as input format and the other as output format, it should be useful to link them since they can be used in together in a pipeline. In other cases there would be an overlap in domains, or in authors, or in any other aspects. If you like experimental qualitative data science, this project is for you.
