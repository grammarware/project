In modern software development, the practice of refactoring plays a vital role in enhancing code quality, facilitating maintainability, and ensuring scalability. On the other hand, identifying applied refactorings in software development is also important as it provides insight into the developer's thought process, helps track code changes, and aids in debugging potential issues. To support this practice, a number of refactoring detection tools have been developed, including **RefDetect** [1], **[RefactoringMiner](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner)** [2], **[RefDiff](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/RefDiff)** [3], **PyRef** [4], and **[RefactorInsight](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14704-refactorinsight)** [5] which are capable of detecting applied refactorings in applications developed in different programming languages.

Recently, we have developed a tool capable of detecting refactorings in Java and C++ applications [1]. The tool is designed to be language-independent and can be easily extended to support new object-oriented programming languages. To further expand the tool's capabilities, we are seeking a candidate with strong programming skills and familiarity with Java to join our team and work on extending the tool's capabilities to support a new object-oriented programming language.

As part of the project, the candidate student will use the current parser to extract code information in the target object-oriented language (e.g., Python) and store it in an existing intermediate data structure. Note that the remaining components responsible for detecting refactorings will remain unchanged and uses information stored in the intermediate data structures. The implemented tool will be thoroughly examined to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting refactorings in the newly supported object-oriented programming language.
