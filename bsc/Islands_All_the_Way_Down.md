# Islands All the Way Down

Next to numerous [parsing techniques](https://dickgrune.com/Books/PTAPG_2nd_Edition/), there are also [semiparsing](http://grammarware.net/text/2014/semiparsing.pdf) techniques such as fuzzy parsing, island parsing, permissive parsing, etc. Most of them are defined only informally, in a form of a working tool and its documentation. Choose one of the semiparsing methods (e.g., [lake symbols](https://programming-journal.org/2021/5/11/) published in 2021, there's also a [presentation on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW8squsKong)), understanding the tool and/or the documentation behind it, (re)define the core algorithm more formally and/or rigorously, up to the point where you can make some provable statements ("method X is a weaker variant of method Y" or "method X works in linear time" or "false negatives of X kind are impossible", etc), make an implementation that aligns with this new definition.

As a BSc project, there will be time for one case study to prototype. As an example, have a look at [Gerk-Jan Huisma](https://github.com/ghuisma/lake-parser-combinators)'s [thesis](http://purl.utwente.nl/essays/91950) and/or [code](https://github.com/grammarhoard/2022-huisma-lake-parsing).

Get in touch with your [potential future supervisor](mailto:v.zaytsev@utwente.nl) to discuss details!
