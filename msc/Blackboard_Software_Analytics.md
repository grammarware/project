Software analytics frameworks are traditionally either made in the imperative paradigm, where the analyst programs all the steps, leading to great performance, poor modularity and almost no parallelisation opportunities, or in the declarative paradigm, where modularity is granted by design, but the analyst cannot influence the choice of data structures and algorithms used. Recently, an alternative setup was proposed, based on the [Blackboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_(design_pattern)) pattern, where each analysis is calculated imperatively and retains control over the data it produces by providing a callback function invoked on updates. The prototype is [open source](https://dl.acm.org/do/10.5281/zenodo.3872848/full/) and is accompanied by a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3368089.3409765) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No93SZ6rz-0). This project is about designing and implementing a similar framework for analysing software.
