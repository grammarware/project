# One's Nightmare is Another's Demo

[BabyCobol](https://slebok.github.io/baby/) is a language that was designed to be the “[worst nightmare](https://doi.org/10.1145/3426425.3426933)” of compiler writers, deliberately combining worst features of the oldest and the ugliest programming languages (YT). Unfortunately, some of the most important software — that of banks, insurance and booking companies, military — is written in such languages, and in order to tackle them successfully, you need to train on smaller prey. BabyCobol is used in one of the CS MSc courses at UT, Software Evolution, where students treat it as a challenge and work towards its full implementation over the two months. For them, the goal is to implement as many features as possible, no matter the cost.

The goal of this project is different: take one language framework (good lists can be found on [this website](https://cocodo.github.io/) under "Technologies" tab or in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cl.2015.08.007) in §4), implement whatever you can in it and report on difficulties. Sounds easy, right? Well, perhaps all this talk about BabyCobol being a nightmare is just for show…
