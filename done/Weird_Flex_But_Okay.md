# Weird Flex But Okay

It is a known problem in software analytics that a single commit in a repository actually can cover multiple issues (e.g., fix a bug and rename some related methods). To untangle such commits into separate concerns, in 2020 several British scientists have developed a technique called [Delta Name Flow Graph](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3368089.3409693) (ùõø-NFG for short) and implemented it in a tool called [Flexeme](https://dl.acm.org/do/10.5281/zenodo.3894559/full/), freely available as open source. Their tool is written in Python and works on C# code ‚Äî and this project is about doing the same for another language like Java.

The project was done by **Cato de Kruif** aka [**@catoostrophe**](https://github.com/catoostrophe):
